   * Initiates a controlled application restart.

   * @remarks
   * This method schedules a process exit with code `1` after a short delay.
   * Container supervisors (e.g., Docker, systemd, PM2) interpret this as a failure
   * and automatically restart the container or process.
   *
   * The restart logic does **not** manually spawn a new Node.js process,
   * avoiding port conflicts and ensuring consistent runtime state.
   *
   * @example
   * Trigger restart via Kafka:
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "topic": "admin.restart",
   *   "payload": {}
   * }

   *   -H "x-api-key: super-secret-key"
   * ```
   *
